## Surprisal values from XGLM models
This repository contains the code to compute surprisal values from XGLM model. We used the MECO corpus and the XGLM model family to assess the relationship between the _psychological accuracy_ of a language model (namely, the capability of a surprisal estimate to explain variance in human responses) and its _linguistic accuracy_ (i.e., its ability to accurately predict the next token).
